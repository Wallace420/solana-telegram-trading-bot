- Profit MaxiMode: This feature enables users to sell large amounts of cryptocurrency, such as 100 SOL, more strategically. Rather than selling everything in one go, which could drive the price down, the system splits the sell order into smaller increments that are executed only when there’s sufficient buying demand. This allows users to sell without significantly impacting the price.
